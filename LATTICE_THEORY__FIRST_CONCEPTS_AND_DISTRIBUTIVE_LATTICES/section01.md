Let $P$ be a partially ordered set. Since $x = x$ for all $x$ in $P$, $x \lt x$ for no $x$.

Assume $x \lt y$ and $y \lt z$.
Since $x \le y$ and $y \le z$, we have $x \le z$.
If $x = z$. then we have $x \le y$ and $y \le x$.
This implies $x = y$ due to the antisymmetry of a parially ordered set.
Since $x = y$ contradicts to $x \lt y$, we have $x \ne z$.
Therefore, we have $x \lt z$
